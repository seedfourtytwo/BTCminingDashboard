- External dependencies are introduced gradually

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with static data to validate core functionality
- Build and test incrementally - no big-bang development
- Validate API design through UI usage early
- Focus on accuracy and reliability over features initially
- Learn from each phase before moving to the next

3. **User-Centric Design**: Validate through UI usage early
4. **Performance First**: Optimize as you build, not after
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling from day one
6. **Documentation**: Document as you build, not at the end
