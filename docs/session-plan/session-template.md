## 🌿 Git Workflow
- **Create dedicated branch**: `git checkout -b feature/[session-name]` (if not already on appropriate branch)
- **Commit frequently**: Small, focused commits with clear messages
- **Push regularly**: `gitß push -u origin feature/[session-name]` to backup work and trigger CI/CD
- **Direct merge**: Since CI/CD runs on push and this is solo development, direct merging is efficient
- **Note**: PRs are valuable for team projects but add overhead for solo development
