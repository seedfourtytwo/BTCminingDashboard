# Session 02: Database Deployment to Development Environment

## 🎯 Goal
Deploy the consolidated database schema to the development environment (which serves as staging) and verify it's working correctly.

## 📋 Single Task
**Database Deployment**: Deploy the consolidated database schema to development environment and run migrations

## 🧠 Learning Focus
- Cloudflare D1 database deployment process
- Wrangler CLI for database management
- Migration execution and verification
- Development environment as staging setup

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Database schema deployed to development environment
- [ ] All migrations executed successfully
- [ ] Seed data loaded into development database
- [ ] Database connection verified from API worker
- [ ] Basic table structure confirmed in development

## 🚀 Execution Steps
1. **[Verify current setup]**: Check existing development database configuration
2. **[Deploy database schema]**: Run consolidated migrations on development environment
3. **[Load seed data]**: Execute seed.sql to populate development with test data
4. **[Verify deployment]**: Test database connectivity from API worker
5. **[Validate structure]**: Confirm all tables and data are accessible

## 📝 Notes
- Use existing `solar-mining-db-dev` database (already configured)
- Development environment serves as staging for testing
- Use existing npm scripts for database operations
- Seed data includes equipment, locations, and system configurations
- Verify both read and write operations work correctly
