# Session 01: Database Seeding

## 🎯 Goal
Populate the database with realistic equipment data (ASIC miners, solar panels, battery storage).

## 📋 Single Task
**Database Seeding**: Create and insert realistic equipment data into our Cloudflare D1 database.

## 🧠 Learning Focus
- Database seeding patterns
- Data validation and integrity
- Realistic test data creation

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Database has realistic ASIC miner data (Antminer S19, S21, etc.)
- [ ] Database has realistic solar panel data (popular models)
- [ ] Database has realistic battery storage data
- [ ] All data validates against our schema
- [ ] Can query and retrieve the data successfully

## 🚀 Execution Steps
1. **Research**: Find current ASIC miner, solar panel, and battery specs
2. **Create Seed Data**: Build SQL insert statements with realistic data
3. **Test**: Run migrations and verify data integrity

## 📝 Notes
- Focus on 5-10 popular models of each equipment type
- Use current market prices and specifications
- Keep it simple - we can add more data later

## 🔄 Session Update
**Note**: During this session, we went off-track to refactor the database schema. We consolidated 7 separate migration files into one comprehensive schema (`0001_consolidated_schema.sql`) that includes:
- Battery-free mining support
- Environmental performance tracking
- Business analysis capabilities
- Equipment value depreciation
- API-aligned environmental data
- Single-user manual equipment entry

This consolidation simplifies development and provides a solid foundation for the project.
