# Solar Bitcoin Mining Calculator

A planning and projection tool for solar-powered Bitcoin mining operations.

## Project Overview

This application enables Bitcoin miners to plan and optimize solar-powered mining operations by providing projections, equipment management, and economic analysis tools. The system supports solar power modeling with location-specific environmental data.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Development in Progress** - This is a personal project in early development.

### What's Implemented
- âœ… Project structure and architecture
- âœ… Database schema with 6 migrations
- âœ… API worker structure
- âœ… Calculation worker structure
- âœ… Data worker structure
- âœ… Documentation suite (13 files)
- âœ… Landing page with feature overview

### What's Coming Next
- ðŸ”„ Equipment selection interface
- ðŸ”„ Solar power modeling calculations
- ðŸ”„ Mining profitability projections
- ðŸ”„ Financial analysis

## Key Features

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Wrangler CLI
- Cloudflare account

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Wrangler: `wrangler login`
4. Set up database: `npm run db:migrate`

### Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to Cloudflare

## Database Schema

The database includes 18+ tables across 6 migrations:

- **Core Foundation**: Users, locations, equipment models
- **System Configuration**: User system setups and configurations
- **External Data**: Bitcoin network, price, and environmental data
- **Projections**: Scenario analysis and calculation results
- **Historical Data**: Equipment value tracking over time
- **Error Handling**: Application error logging and debugging

## API Endpoints

### Health Checks
- `GET /health` - API worker health
- `GET /calculate/health` - Calculation worker health
- `GET /data/health` - Data worker health

### API Routes
- `/api/v1/equipment` - Equipment management
- `/api/v1/projections` - Projection calculations
- `/api/v1/system-configs` - System configurations
- `/api/v1/locations` - Location data
- `/api/v1/bitcoin` - Bitcoin network data
- `/api/v1/environmental` - Environmental data
